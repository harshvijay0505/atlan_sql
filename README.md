# Getting Started with Frontend SQL Editor

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

It is a dummy frontend web-based application which is runnning predefined SQL queries 'Select * from Students;' and 'Select * from Accounts;' and displaying the pre defined Tables accordingly.

The application includes a Code Editor which accepts SQL queries in the form of user inputs, then runs the given query, and displays the result within the application.

I have used variables (such as flags) with values true or false to toggle between the buttons and display the result for both the queries one at a time. 

I have also included some features which will display the datatype of attributes of all the tables present in the table on the left side while on right side I have displayed all the Available tables in the database

**Note**: Since this is a dummy frontend application, there is no backend connected and all tables used or displayed are pre defined and hence no other queries apart from above mentioned queries will execute. I have defined only two queries for this application so the output will be same no matter what you write. 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
