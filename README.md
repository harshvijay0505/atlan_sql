## Overview

It is a dummy frontend web-based application which is runnning predefined SQL queries 'Select * from Students;' and 'Select * from Accounts;' and displaying the pre defined Tables accordingly.

The application includes a Code Editor which accepts SQL queries in the form of user inputs, then runs the given query, and displays the result within the application.

I have used variables (such as flags) with values true or false to toggle between the buttons and display the result for both the queries one at a time. 

I have also included some features which will display the datatype of attributes of all the tables present in the table on the left side using mui tree while on right side I have displayed all the Available tables in the database

**Note**: Since this is a dummy frontend application, there is no backend connected and all tables used or displayed are pre defined and hence no other queries apart from above mentioned queries will execute. I have defined only two queries for this application so the output will be same no matter what you write.
